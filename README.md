# Founder's Community Dev Trail

Built an AI-powered Research Assistant built using **LangChain** and **OpenAI's GPT model**. The application enables users to efficiently interact with research papers by generating summaries, extracting citations and references, and answering specific queries related to the paper’s content.

## Features

- **Research Paper Summary**: Automatically generates a concise summary of the input research paper.
- **Citations and References Extraction**: Extracts a list of citations and references from the research paper.
- **Query Response**: Provides answers to user queries based on the content of the research paper.

## Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: A framework for building applications using language models.
- **OpenAI GPT**: Utilized for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Streamlit**: A framework to quickly build and deploy the web application.
- **Python**: Core programming language for development.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

## How It Works

<ul>
    <li>Upload a research paper: Users upload a PDF of the research paper they want to work with.</li>
    <li>Generate summary: The model processes the text and generates a concise summary.</li>
    <li>Extract citations: The system extracts references and citations from the document.</li>
    <li>Answer queries: The model can answer any specific queries related to the content of the paper.</li>
</ul>
